      "The course offers excellent practical skills, which is very important in this profession. Yulia shares her experience throughout the learning process, teaching how to do things correctly from the very beginning and explaining the consequences of mistakes. She is very friendly, positive, and most importantly, incredibly patient. Highly recommend!",
      "I learned about nail filing from fashion bloggers. I became very curious: “What kind of manicure is this?” and “Why has it become so trendy?” When I saw that Yulia was launching course on Dry File Manicure, I was excited that we could finally see and try this technique. As a professional who works only in a combined technique, I thought it was impossible to do a manicure without e-tools, drills, and remover. How wrong I was. Nail filing is amazing, easy, and safe. Nail filing is not just a manicure technique, it's a whole philosophy.",
      "A really great course. I liked the informativeness, clarity of explanations, and comfort. Each lesson teaches you something new to practice. My mom and sister are happy with the manicure. A big plus is that the lessons are personal, and all the attention is on you. I recommend it to anyone who wants to quickly and comfortably master new information!"
